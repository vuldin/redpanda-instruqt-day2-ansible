teaser: Learn how to manage Redpanda after deploying with Ansible
description: |-
  Redpanda is a Kafka-compatible streaming data platform that is less complex and less costly than any other commercial mission-critical event streaming platform. It's fast, it's easy, and it keeps your data safe.

  The Redpanda Ansible playbook allows you to deploy a production-grade Redpanda cluster on bare-metal servers or VMs in a fully repeatable, fully customisable way.

  In this tutorial, you'll learn how to deploy and manage Redpanda using Ansible.
